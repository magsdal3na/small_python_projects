Each of these programs is a small way to test my knowledge and understanding of Python.

1. Random Number Generator
    - This program generates a random number which the user then has to guess.
      The program will tell the user if their guess is too high or too low as hints.
      This program highlights the use of the random module and feedback based on
      user input.
2. Rock, Paper, Scissors
    - This program plays rock, paper, scissors with the user. The program has a
      score output that will show the user they're total points vs. the computer's
      total points. The winner is determined by who can get three points first.
      "Best of three" rules. This program highlights selection trees, comparison
      against a random value, and variable increasing.
3. Password Strength Checker
    - This program tells the user, based on their input, how strong or weak a
      password is based on a set list of criteria. This program highlights
      parameter checking against what a user has input and selection trees.
